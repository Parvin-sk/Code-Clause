Filterable Image Gallery is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to filter images by category, making it easy to navigate and view specific images. The application features a clean and intuitive design, with a responsive layout that adapts to various devices and screen sizes.
The project utilizes HTML5 for structuring the content, CSS3 for styling and layout, and JavaScript (ES6+) for adding interactivity and functionality. The filterable gallery is achieved through JavaScript code that dynamically updates the displayed images based on user input.
To use the application, simply clone the repository or download the zip file, and open the imagegallery.html file in your preferred web browser. Use the filter buttons to categorize and view images.
